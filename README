jcm is a SOAP-based Java library for version 2 of the Campaign Monitor API - http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/v2/

The Campaign Monitor API publishes a WSDL document at http://api.createsend.com/api/api.asmx?wsdl and proxy classes found in the com.campaignmonitor.api.types package are generated using the jaxws-maven-plugin.

To use the functionality of this API wrapper in your own Java application, you can simply include the jcm.jar file as a library and call the underlying API methods from there.

For examples of how the underlying API methods are called, see the com.campaignmonitor.api.console.Console class.
